## Introduction

In this section we will create a dead simple small app. We will adhere to these guidelines:

- Follow the current best practices
- Maintain code quality via linting
- Engage ourselves in shift-left testing
- Use github actions for our CI
- Do TDD (not religiously) via unit testing
- Do test coverage
- Write acceptance criteria for our BDD Testing

For those who aare reading this, I assume you have a basic knowledge in NodeJS and Git. I will try my best to make this friendly for absolute begineers also.
